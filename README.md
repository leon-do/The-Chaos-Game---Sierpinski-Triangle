# The Chaos Game-Sierpinski Triangle

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/fjpkjzh.png)


1. Start with a random point inside the triangle. Let's call this the previous point
2. Pick a random vertex
3. Draw a point in between the random point and the vertex
4. Make the new point the previous point
5. repeat steps 2-5

Even though the vertex is picked at random, the 'chaos' will make a Sierpinski Triangle.
